* Representative of Item 64: Strive for failure atomicity.
*
* This item basically suggest that the failed method invocation
* should leave the object in the state that it was in prior to the
* invocation.
* 
* TODO: I cannot think of any practical example in this case, except 
* the one already provided in the book so I will leave it at that.
